Started with B-C-1.04_02. The perl compiler was previously in CORE.
Try to get info about versions later.

1.04_02 2008-01-22 rurban
	* removed from CORE, now on CPAN. 
	* added byteorder to bytecode header.
	* added support for 5.10, 5.9.5 not tested, up to 5.8.x already in CORE. 
	maybe add backwards support later, when C/CC is improved or more features 
	are added.
	* added type hekindex
	* added c.t and cc.t tests
	* extended bytecode.pl format: added version logic 
	to have strictly consecutive indices
