	* t/testcore.t: added
	* t/c_argv.t: added. test @ARGV and perlcc
	* perlcc (2.06): grab_stash only via new -stash, not automatically;
	  B::C is better.
	ldopts -std only when modules are given.
	fix for empty options.
	add -sharedxs, -sharedlib; -shared is now for shared linkage, 
	  -sharedlib to create a shared lib (was -shared before but never worked),
	  -sharedxs to also link shared xsubs, no run-time DynaLoader/XSLoader needed.

1.09	2009-12-27 rurban
	* C.pm: Cut down the number of AUTOLOAD'ed optrees, search only on 
	  empty gv->cv (31).
	Added very unsafe -O4/-fcop to eliminate most cops and file + line numbers.
	Added faster -fav-init to -O2, less unneeded av_extend().
	Get rid of fbm_compile (11). Only 5.8.9 is broken.

	* ByteLoader/Makefile: tuning, bytecode.h triggers now byterun.c
	* bytecode.h: Specialize pregcomp on 5.10; add PL_regex_pad[0] for 
	  pregcomp if missing. fixes tests 3,4,5,7,31 on 5.10.

1.07	2009-12-19 rurban
	* C.pm: fix fbm_compile (INDEX) for >= 5.10. gv_list is already a pointer.

	* C.pm: Had to disable -O1 -fcog (pv_copy_on_grow) on 5.10 and higher
	  until I find out how to fool S_unshare_hek_or_pvn. This fixes all C
	  -O1 and -O2 tests. Warn about this.
	Fix wrong RV init on *5.10* for test 29 also, as with 5.11.
	Simplify __DATA__ handling. Warn when -O3 or -fsava-data is missing.

1.04_30 2009-12-13 rurban
	Better 5.6 support, but Bytecode compiler still disabled.
	Not even the Byteloader works for 5.6 assembled code. The Disassembler 
	does not stop at ret. Fixed several C tests.

	* bytecode.pl: renumbering policy: <= 5.6 squeeze, >= 5.8 fixed
	to force exact bytecode numbering as with 5.8.
	Allow float versions, such as 10.001 for subreleases.

	Add perlversion to header.
	Add byteorder check logic.
	
	Added logic to include all possible unsupported ops, all holes.
	bytecode table checked for 5.6.1, 5.6.2, 5.8.0, 5.8.1-5.11
	Note, that I found official and contradicting 5.6.1 releases. 
	ActiveState 5.6.1.626 had no op_children, the unix release tarball 
	with 5.6.1 (called Trial 1) still has it.
	
	* ByteLoader.pm (1.06_06): better bytecode numbering.
	* Asmdata.pm (1.02_02): strict numbering along 5.8.
	Unsupported ops are now also included, with PUT method 0.
	* Assembler.pm (0.07_07): Add perlversion to header
	* Disassembler.pm (1.05_04): Add perlversion to header.
	Print header only for existing.

	CORE compiler.
	* disassemble: Make it work with the older Disassembler.
	Make it work with older bytecode >= 5.8 via Asmdata unsupported ops.
	* i386.xs, jitcompiler.pl: removed (seperate module)
	* bytecode.h, C.xs: Fixed for 5.6, tested with 5.6.1 with MSVC.
	* bytecode.h, byterun.c: add static int force = 0. Override it to 1 to 
	try out executing older bytecodes.

	* C.pm: fix test 16 on 5.10 again, non-threaded only (GVAV magic). 
	  first fix in 1.04_24, broken in 1.04_28. On 5.11 I have a broken 
	  RV handling here.
	Remove version and Regexp::DESTROY from the automatic methods 
	(experimental).
	First attempts with pv and hek consting failed.
	* t/testc.sh, t/testplc.sh: support proper cmdline arguments, add -h for 
	help
	Fixed test 5 by fixing the wrong test.
	* perloptree.pod: renamed from perloptreeguts.pod. Added links.

1.04_29 2009-12-07 rurban
	Disable the Bytecode compiler for 5.6. Fixed besides the __DATA__ handle 
	  (test 15) all remaining 5.8 C bugs.
	* C.pm: assign the PVX of GV also for empty stashes (main::) to avoid 
	  destruction failures at Perl_pad_undef() SvPVX_const(namesv) == '&'. 
	Fixes tests 14 and 23
	* byterun.c: No assert on empty bs_sv, it is &PL_sv_undef.
	Map missing -Dv on 5.6 to -Df i.e. -D256
	Added better debugging output: setter values.
	* STATUS: re-run CORE tests, list cmdlines, update status
	* Disassembler.pm: added gen_header_hash() for gen_header output. 
	  add to documentation.
	* Bytecode.pm: -S uses gen_header_hash for gen_header output.

1.04_28 2009-12-06 rurban
	* C.pm: fix -fcog (Copy on Grow with -O1 and -O2) for >= 5.10 by a new 
	  SVPV. 
	Statically initialize PVs with a union layout trick. Use char* as first 
	  union member. 
	Revert xpvcv+svsect changes to pre-initialize those structs against 
	  gvcv recursion. 
	* t/b.t, t/o.t, t/stash.t: fix tests for 5.6.2
	* bytecode.c: byteorder swab only if same length. 
	1234 => 4321, 12345678 => 87654321.
	Skip a 0x prefix for byteorder in the header. Perl 5.6 had this. 
	* Assembler.pm (0.07_06): 5.6 byteorder fix: until 5.6 the 
	  $Config{byteorder} was falsely dependent on ivsize, we need longsize.
	Add 0x to byteorder in header again, as with 5.6.
	* t/testc.sh: do not run old leftovers. some 5.6 optimizations
	* t/c_o1.t, t/c_o2.t, t/cc_o2.t, t/cc_o2.t: added

	  the ending nul byte. 
	  5.10: new minlen check aborts
	* ByteLoader security: added strconst maxsize flag to bytecode.pl 
	  for buffer overflow checks.
	* Bytecode -DA for devel assertions of absolute or probably wrong opindex 
	  pointers (nyi)
	* disassemble, B::Assembler: commented output, similar to -MO=Bytecode,-S

	* Hangs in C/CC executables at an op_free(PL_main_root) trying to free 
          the static op structs because the earlier op_seq -1 hack is gone now, 
	  and opt_static was replaced by opt_latefree. Set now opt_latefree = 1.

    more logical for them to be in B.pm, rather than in the "boilerplate"
