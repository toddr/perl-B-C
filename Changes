	fix for empty options.
	add -sharedxs, -sharedlib; -shared is now for shared linkage, 
	  -sharedlib to create a shared lib (was -shared before but never worked),
	  -sharedxs to also link shared xsubs, no run-time DynaLoader/XSLoader needed.

1.09	2009-12-27 rurban
	* C.pm: Cut down the number of AUTOLOAD'ed optrees, search only on 
	  empty gv->cv (31).
	Added very unsafe -O4/-fcop to eliminate most cops and file + line numbers.

1.07	2009-12-19 rurban
	* C.pm: fix fbm_compile (INDEX) for >= 5.10. gv_list is already a pointer.

	* C.pm: Had to disable -O1 -fcog (pv_copy_on_grow) on 5.10 and higher
	  until I find out how to fool S_unshare_hek_or_pvn. This fixes all C
	  -O1 and -O2 tests. Warn about this.

	does not stop at ret. Fixed several C tests.

	* bytecode.pl: renumbering policy: <= 5.6 squeeze, >= 5.8 fixed
	to force exact bytecode numbering as with 5.8.

	Add byteorder check logic.
	
	Added logic to include all possible unsupported ops, all holes.
	bytecode table checked for 5.6.1, 5.6.2, 5.8.0, 5.8.1-5.11
	Note, that I found official and contradicting 5.6.1 releases. 
	ActiveState 5.6.1.626 had no op_children, the unix release tarball 
	with 5.6.1 (called Trial 1) still has it.
	
	* ByteLoader.pm (1.06_06): better bytecode numbering.
	* Asmdata.pm (1.02_02): strict numbering along 5.8.
	Unsupported ops are now also included, with PUT method 0.

	CORE compiler.
	* disassemble: Make it work with the older Disassembler.
	Make it work with older bytecode >= 5.8 via Asmdata unsupported ops.
	* i386.xs, jitcompiler.pl: removed (seperate module)
	* bytecode.h, C.xs: Fixed for 5.6, tested with 5.6.1 with MSVC.
	* bytecode.h, byterun.c: add static int force = 0. Override it to 1 to 
	try out executing older bytecodes.

	* C.pm: fix test 16 on 5.10 again, non-threaded only (GVAV magic). 
	  first fix in 1.04_24, broken in 1.04_28. On 5.11 I have a broken 
	  RV handling here.
	Remove version and Regexp::DESTROY from the automatic methods 
	(experimental).
	First attempts with pv and hek consting failed.
	* t/testc.sh, t/testplc.sh: support proper cmdline arguments, add -h for 
	help
	Fixed test 5 by fixing the wrong test.
	* perloptree.pod: renamed from perloptreeguts.pod. Added links.

1.04_29 2009-12-07 rurban
	Disable the Bytecode compiler for 5.6. Fixed besides the __DATA__ handle 
	  (test 15) all remaining 5.8 C bugs.
	* C.pm: assign the PVX of GV also for empty stashes (main::) to avoid 
	  destruction failures at Perl_pad_undef() SvPVX_const(namesv) == '&'. 
	Fixes tests 14 and 23
	* byterun.c: No assert on empty bs_sv, it is &PL_sv_undef.
	Map missing -Dv on 5.6 to -Df i.e. -D256
	Added better debugging output: setter values.
	* STATUS: re-run CORE tests, list cmdlines, update status
	* Disassembler.pm: added gen_header_hash() for gen_header output. 
	  add to documentation.

	* C.pm: fix -fcog (Copy on Grow with -O1 and -O2) for >= 5.10 by a new 
	  SVPV. 
	Statically initialize PVs with a union layout trick. Use char* as first 
	  union member. 
	Revert xpvcv+svsect changes to pre-initialize those structs against 
	  gvcv recursion. 
	* t/b.t, t/o.t, t/stash.t: fix tests for 5.6.2
	* bytecode.c: byteorder swab only if same length. 
	1234 => 4321, 12345678 => 87654321.
	Skip a 0x prefix for byteorder in the header. Perl 5.6 had this. 
	* Assembler.pm (0.07_06): 5.6 byteorder fix: until 5.6 the 
	  $Config{byteorder} was falsely dependent on ivsize, we need longsize.
	Add 0x to byteorder in header again, as with 5.6.
	* t/testc.sh: do not run old leftovers. some 5.6 optimizations
	* t/c_o1.t, t/c_o2.t, t/cc_o2.t, t/cc_o2.t: added

	  5.10: new minlen check aborts
	* ByteLoader security: added strconst maxsize flag to bytecode.pl

	  Engine not initialized though.
	* Hangs in C/CC executables at an op_free(PL_main_root) trying to free 
          the static op structs because the earlier op_seq -1 hack is gone now, 
	  and opt_static was replaced by opt_latefree. Set now opt_latefree = 1.
          This fixed tests 1 and 13. Slowly making progress step by step.

1.04_12 2008-03-16 rurban (first upload)

1.04_10 2008-02-26 rurban
	
	* change bc pvx access
	  dummy struct bytestate_xpv, so pv has the same fields as with 5.8, 
	  seperated from the sv. The sv is seperated from the pv.

	* change op_reflags from U16 to U32
	* guarantee ByteLoader backwards compatibility: Accept lower versions also.

1.04_09 2008-02-25 rurban
	* restored 5.8 backwards compatibility, mainly for test comparison.

	* added new asm opcode op_reflags
	* removed Bytecode cop_arybase for 5.10
	* 5.8 compatibility: fixed bytecode.pl versioning, Asmdata creation 
	  (exact same for 5.8.8), asmdata.t, b.t tests
	* improved make clean
	* add ByteLoader -Dt and -Dv debugging
	* don't link against jit code against possible sideeffects
	* fixed c.t and cc.t tests

1.04_08 2008-02-22 rurban
	* fixed t/b.t tests for 5.11 (REGEXP, ref RV => IV)
	* fixed Makefile.PL deps to ignore the interim .pl files
	* added PMOP reflags
	* added madprop to B-1.18_01 and B::C (if provided by B)
	* enhanced B::Debug 1.05_02
	* fixed B::C PL_cshlen (already initialized since 5.10)
	* fixed B::C GvFILE
	* fixed various (SV)xpv list casts and inits, 
	* fixed B::C xpvnv_list for 5.10
	* fixed B::C xpvio_list for 5.10
	* fixed B::C pmopsect for 5.11
	* bootstrap also all $Config{static_ext}, not only dynamic stashes

	* enhanced B::Debug (no version bump)
	* fixed general op_list inits, and specials for av, hv
	* almost fixed pv within sv handling
	* added -O=C,-DS for SV debugging

1.04_05 2008-02-18 rurban
	* added t/test.pl and t/test*.sh to MANIFEST. 
	* fixed ByteLoader reading from the <DATA> filter.
	* fixed -H .plc header parsing
	* updated Bytecode options in NOTES and pod
	* added -O=Bytecode,-v option
	* fixed PL_preprocess and SvREPADTMP_off for 5.11

1.04_04 2008-02-08 rurban

	* removed from CORE, now on CPAN. 
	* added byteorder to bytecode header.
	* added support for 5.10 (NOT WORKING!), 5.9.5 not tested.

	  are added.

===================================================================

B::C was at 1.05 when removed from core with 5.9.4.

Nick Ing-Simmons <nik@tiuk.ti.com>  1998-12-05 11:44:28
    @2452 B.xs had its own code to calculate hash() which differed from
    PERL_HASH in hv.h - so all saved HV's were mangled - including %INC
    which meant that run-time require was re-done.

    @2378 More C.pm tweaks
      Save globs even if we have saved cv itself before - may be imported.
    
      While we don't save "bootstrap" CV we need to provide a stub,
      so that if we require it later we don't fall through and attempt
      to DynaLoad module again.
    
      Attempt to save %INC so that "require" does not reload things
      we have compiled-in (does not work right yet - seems to be due
      to PL_incgv being created in perl_parse() current scheme setting
      GvHV() is "better" than saving the glob, but still does not
      work as I expect).

Nick Ing-Simmons <nik@tiuk.ti.com>  1998-11-27 22:10:27
    @2332 Handle INIT list in C.pm
    1. Provide init_av() from B.xs
    2. Export it in B.pm
    3. Use it in C.pm
    Also disable some pruning in savecv() which seems to undo
    my previous patch.
    Experimental feature - save pathnames of .so files in easily
    grep-able form for use in wrapper to feed to linker.

	* Merge perlext/Compiler/... into mainline. Some files move to
    ext/B/..., some to lib/B/..., O.pm and B.pm go in lib and some
    move to the base perl directory (e.g. headers). Will need some
