Byteloader segfaults on all versions, even 5.8 (!).
B::C produces no compilable code yet.

5.10, 5.11 status
-----------------
pvx: seems to be fixed in B::C
  With the move of the pvx field from xpv to the sv, we have to solve 
  that differently for the Bytecode and C backend.
  Bytecode can simply mimic the old XPV behaviour of a 3 field struct 
  (pvx, cur, len) to simplify pv handling.
hv: crash at invalid entry in hv_store in B::HV::save

5.8 status
----------
I've restored 5.8 backwards compatibility, mainly for test comparison.
CPAN installations will still abort, but that can be easily overridden.
ByteLoader is now backwards compatible: Accepts lower versions also.

JIT
---
B-C-1.04_10:
playing with the idea to target against parrot pir instead of lightning
and use the parrot jit, with pbc_to_exe or exec_save.
Then we need no jit support in the ByteLoader and get rid of all the Jit 
stuff for now. => B::PIR

B-C-1.04_03:
added Jit and Asm layout, with the idea of using either 
lightning as jit backend (Jit), or creating our own assembler (Asm) 
to be able to use a high-level language.
